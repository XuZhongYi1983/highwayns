Thanks for downloading SocialAuth.Net 2.4!!


*********************
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE
*********************
1. If you've upgraded from a previous version and have been using Google Wrapper, you'd need to change the name of wrapper from GoogleWrapper to GoogleHybridWrapper in your config as we've upgraded Google Wrapper to use their OAuth 2.0 flow. However, previous OAuth 1.0 Hybrid is still there For more details refer to 

2. Also, we've upgraded LinkedIn to use OAuth2.0. If you do not make any changes, your application will automatically start using LinkedIn OAuth2.0. Unlike Google, you do not need to make any changes. If you still intend to use LinkedIn 1.0, Please change your wrapper in config to LinkedIn1Wrapper (from LinkedInWrapper).
